General
========

I've decided to release my Watch Dogs Script Hook as I still receive questions about the game and I don't really actively develop this (last commit around June).

Watch Dogs Script Hook
========

A script hook for Watch Dogs which exposes the lua API functions to users to allow them to create their own scripts. 
Doesn't work on the current version of the game. Supposed to act as an educational resource for game hacking, since it's 
very hacky and very bad/ugly code (e.g. mixed naming conventions). The last thing I was working on was getting lua callbacks
for the d3d hook to work, but never found the time to properly implement it. The threading model is also very hacky. 

Please don't blame for any code issues, this project is discontinued and was just a quick PoC. In addition, I never worked 
with lua so this implementation is probably going to hurt everyone who ever seriously worked with lua. Feel free to 
contribute/update for current version. Also feel free to ask questions, though I may not be able to answer since it's a 
long time since I worked on this.

Have fun and happy REing!
